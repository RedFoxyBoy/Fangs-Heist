This mod aims to reinvent the wheel of Pizza Time mods by offering a fun and unique experience that binds together collect-a-thon and heart-pumping fighting into one SRB2 gametype for players to enjoy.

This mod is completely reusable. Do as you wish with it!

...So, I don't know how to explain this. Can someone fill this out for me? Thanks!
